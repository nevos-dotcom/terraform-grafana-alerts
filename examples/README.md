# Examples

This directory contains example configurations for different datasource types.

## Prometheus Example (Docker Compose)

The `example.tf` file demonstrates setting up alerts with a local Prometheus instance using Docker Compose.

### Usage

1. Start the stack:
   ```bash
   make start
   ```

2. Configure your variables:
   ```bash
   cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
   # Edit terraform.tfvars with your values
   ```

3. Apply the configuration:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```

4. View Grafana at http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin)

5. Clean up:
   ```bash
   make down
   ```

### Services Included
- **Grafana**: http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin)
- **Prometheus**: http://localhost:9090
- **Elasticsearch**: http://localhost:9200 (with auto-populated test data)
- **Node Exporter**: http://localhost:9100/metrics

## CloudWatch Example

The `cloudwatch-example.tf` file demonstrates setting up alerts with AWS CloudWatch metrics.

### Prerequisites

- Grafana instance with CloudWatch datasource configured
- AWS credentials configured
- Grafana API key with alerting permissions

### Usage

1. Configure your variables:
   ```bash
   cp cloudwatch.tfvars.example cloudwatch.tfvars
   # Edit cloudwatch.tfvars with your AWS resources and Grafana details
   ```

2. Apply the configuration:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform apply -var-file="cloudwatch.tfvars"
   ```

### Required Variables

- `grafana_api_key`: Your Grafana API key
- `grafana_url`: Your Grafana instance URL
- `cloudwatch_datasource_uid`: UID of your CloudWatch datasource in Grafana
- `contact_point_name`: Name of your notification contact point
- `ec2_instance_id`: EC2 instance to monitor
- `rds_instance_id`: RDS instance to monitor
- `alb_name`: Application Load Balancer to monitor

## Configuration Differences

### Prometheus Alerts
```hcl
alerts = [
  {
    name        = "High CPU Usage"
    metric_expr = "100 - (avg(irate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode=\"idle\"}[5m])) * 100)"
    operator    = ">"
    threshold   = 80
    severity    = "warning"
  }
]
```

### CloudWatch Alerts
```hcl
alerts = [
  {
    name        = "High CPU Usage"
    namespace   = "AWS/EC2"
    metric_name = "CPUUtilization"
    dimensions = {
      InstanceId = "i-1234567890abcdef0"
    }
    statistic   = "Average"
    operator    = ">"
    threshold   = 80
    severity    = "warning"
  }
]
```

### Elasticsearch Alerts
```hcl
alerts = [
{
    name        = "Elasticsearch High Error Rate"
    index       = "elasticsearch-logs"
    query       = "level:ERROR"
    aggregations = [{
      field          = "@timestamp"
      id             = "2"
      min_doc_count  = "0"
      order          = "asc"
      orderBy        = "_count"
      size           = "0"
      missing        = ""
      type           = "date_histogram"
      interval       = "1m"
    }]
    metric = {
      field               = "_count"
      id                  = "1"
      precision_threshold = ""
      type                = "count"
    }
    operator    = ">"
    threshold   = 1
    pending_for = "10s"
    severity    = "critical"
    description = "Elasticsearch has high error rate (TEST ALERT)"
    team        = "platform"
    component   = "elasticsearch"
  }
]
```
